SpaceX Rockets is a simple tool to fetch and display data about SpaceX rockets. You can access the tool live at [this link](https://zippy-begonia-3c7ed9.netlify.app/).

This tool uses the public SpaceX API to fetch data, then displays this data in a detailed table format, providing users with an easy way to browse and analyze various attributes of different rockets, such as their name, diameter, height, mass, and cost per launch.

## Features
